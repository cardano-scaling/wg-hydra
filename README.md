# Hydra working group

Welcome to the documentation repository of the Hydra working group. It holds defining documents like the working group charter and procedural documentation like meeting notes.

> [!NOTE]
> The working group is currently being formed and a [dedicated git repository](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-hydra) was chosen to form charter and processes. Perspectively individual documents may be moved / integrated to [intersect](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/) or its [working group index](https://intersect.gitbook.io/intersect-working-groups) as the working group gets registered.

## Charter

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The charter itself is in draft status and the first work item of the working group will be to ratify it.

### Why

> Why is this working group needed?

- Scoping _fundable features_ and projects related to Hydra
- Concrete, open governance of the [hydra](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra) project roadmap
  - to be moved to [https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra)
- Potential evolution into broader, scalable transaction processing focused work

### What

> What concrete things are we producing?

- Create and maintain a high-level backlog of _fundable features and projects/RFPs_
- Coordinate ratification by the community through Intersect
- Review and report delivery

### How

> How are we producing results?

- Where and how are work items produced
- Members and how membership is governed
- Meetings and communication channels

## Agenda

> [!WARNING]
> This is very preliminary and more a tool to define scope & purpose of the working group itself. That being said, it should also provoke thought and ideally spark interest in being part of these discussions. [Open an issue ](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-hydra/issues/new) or a PR and we'll get you covered & involved on this journey.
