# Hydra working group

Welcome to the documentation repository of the Hydra working group. It holds defining documents like the working group charter and procedural documentation like meeting notes.

> [!NOTE]
> The working group is currently being formed and a [dedicated git repository](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-hydra) was chosen to form charter and processes. Perspectively individual documents may be moved / integrated to [intersect](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/) or its [working group index](https://intersect.gitbook.io/intersect-working-groups) as the working group gets registered.

## Charter

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The charter itself is in draft status and one of the first work items of the working group will be to ratify it.

### Why

> Why is this working group needed?

- Open discussion and governance of the [hydra](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra) project roadmap
- Identify and scope _fundable features_ and projects related to Hydra into a roadmap to be ratified by the community (e.g. through intersect)
- Break up silos and cross-pollinate projects across the broader domain of scaling Cardano transaction processing

### What

> What are we doing concretely?

- Prioritize and scope out [üí¨ features](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%3Aspeech_balloon%3A+feature%22) from [üí≠ feature ideas](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%3Athought_balloon%3A+idea%22) and [üí° idea discussions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/categories/ideas).
- Create and maintain a high-level backlog of _fundable features and projects/RFPs_ (level of detail to be defined)
- Coordinate ratification by the community through Intersect
- Review and report on individual project deliveries

## Agenda

> [!WARNING]
> This is very preliminary and more a tool to define scope & purpose of the working group itself. That being said, it should also provoke thought and ideally spark interest in being part of these discussions. [Open an issue ](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-hydra/issues/new/choose) or a PR and we'll get you covered & involved on this journey.
