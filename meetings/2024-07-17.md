## Notes

1. overview of last meeting mention about membership policy: counting attendance

2. collect ideas for improvement revisit any overhead in the process? agree on how are we going to agree on next agenda

3. share main agenda item revisit what is hydra-head v1. feedback
  - incrementals top 1 priority
  - battle-tested & bullet proof
  - sdk and more discoverability
      - which heads are available?
      - which capacities they have?
      - how many members?
  - make midgard and hydra compatible
      - adoption comes with tooling (aiken example)
      - last booms came from aiken, blockfrost, etc..
          - where nobody wants to run their own infra
    
4. requested inputs on groomed items
  - sdk for wallet integration with hydra

5. wip by Pi: 
  - spining multiple hydra heads for multiple workflows and monitoring them dinamically
  - start a cip-34 to extend cip-30 to bring backward awarness: if wallet solution for multiple networks would work as switching the network
      - shall we use this space to discuss about this kind of topics?

6. dapps discover heads add information to explorer for dapps like wallets to use as datasource
  - like participants?

7. hydra auction wip delegate sever: way of controlling multiple hydra heads
  - they use purescript to manage all the processes

  The `mlabs-haskell/hydra-auction` repo is deprecated/archived. The new repos are:
      - mlabs-haskell/hydra-auction-frontend
      - mlabs-haskell/hydra-auction-offchain
      - mlabs-haskell/hydra-auction-onchain
  - next step: they exploring about splitting
  - Pi mentions IOG reaching out about hydra control plane (hydra-doom mentioned)
      - https://github.com/obsidiansystems/hydra-pay -- smth similar
      - [api improvement proposal]: take an offset arg to connect from given point in time
      - currently is all history or nothing


8. @Ilia shared an explorati on how they are having the delegation signinig based on consensus
  - its their specific use-case where they do not operate their hydra-nodes but they trust on delegates
  - @George mentioned an approach to take in this scenarios about using the redeemer...

9. jumping into main agenda item: what is head v1?
  - shared roadmap
  - talked about: exclude phantom tokens from snapshots
  - Related comment about phantom token insecurity: https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/358#issuecomment-1422629710
  - discussion over expectations about how the head should close
  - talked about: partial fanout
  - talked about: directly open heads
      - trade-off: commit congestion
      - depends on use-case
      - collect and abort limit the nbr of parties to 5

10. feature poll:
  - Pi: (anything missing we are building it on gummyworm)
      - robustness p2p consensus
      - anything else, they are building it them selfves
      - modularize ledger as we did for sources and sinks
          - explore about a testable query
  - Ilia: 
      - optimistic head closure: https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/198
      - additional rules to the ledger (Pi example: like aditional rules during fanout about always sending 10% to sundaeswap treasury)
  - Phil:
      - light wallets -- web everything (nobody touches backend infrastructure)
      - aim for mass adoption to see actual contributuions

11. closing notes
