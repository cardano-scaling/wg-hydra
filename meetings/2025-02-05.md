## Agenda

Team Update
- Hydra 0.20 with incremental commits is now released
- Next steps are to reduce tech debt and improve stability

Projects and conversations
- Hydrozoa discussion
    - George will be working more on Hydrozoa again
    - Most of the interoperability applying to Hydrozoa applies to vanilla Hydra too
    - State channels as glorified multi-sig wallets .. with a native way to L1
    - Hydrozoa is leaning into this by distinguishing between optimistic and pessimistic states on L1
- P2P DeFi
  - Perry explained the basic concept of P2P DeFi and how it could work with L2 constructs like Hydra or even Midgard
- Discussing different kinds of L2s
    - Size, time scales
    - Optimizing latency vs. throughput
    - Some might be quite permanent
- Fragmenting liquidity?
    - Interoperability to counter-act fragmentation
    - P2P swaps across L2s possible? Related to L2 interop
    - Friction markets don't work well -> need to get composability to get fluid markets
    - George worked on it already a bit: https://github.com/GeorgeFlerovsky/interop-midgard-hydrozoa
- L2 Interoperability
  - Havenâ€™t started just yet
  - George has created an interoperability paper: 
    - https://github.com/GeorgeFlerovsky/interop-midgard-hydrozoa
    - PDF here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iDgSA3hYFt8AEEUI6_cf3NIw-pd2Ds2L/view?usp=sharing
- MeshJS Hydra Package
  - Building a fully fledged Hydra provider: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/tree/feat-hydra-to-beta/packages/hydra
  - Higher-level `HydraInstance` for conveniently committing to head etc.
  - Wen Hydra web ui (to get rid of `hydra-tui`)?
  - Devkits for launching testnets in the works, could also spin up hydra nodes?
- Hydra Doom
  - Tournament was successful!
  - Prompt video of the event incoming
  - Prize distribution was actually completed on the L1 decommit: https://cexplorer.io/policy/d3ad8ab3bbaf06ccadd7076ff3a84eaca0771bb9dcea8bcce239eca9/tx#data
