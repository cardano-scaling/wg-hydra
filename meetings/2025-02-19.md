## Meeting notes

- Hydrozoa update
    - Is picking up steam: Ilia Rodionov is starting on it too
    - Is it Hydra 2.0?
    - Using Scala and Scalus!
    - Protocol differences, but maybe eventually we are converging?
    - Having two implementations right away!?
    - Similar nature of Hydra and Hydrozoa
- Blazar Labs update
    - Wine supply chain tracking - business side work (location, IOT, wine aging)
    - Should have a first prototype including Hydra in a couple weeks!
- Hydra update
    - New multi-version explorer update and ad-hoc demo
    - Observability and metrics, prometheus should still be in there, grafana dashboards are possible
    - Visualization would be fun to have (like we had on hydra-doom)
- Visualizing protocols
    - Our spec, miro transaction traces and how Hydrozoa is specfied
    - A visualizer for L1 transactions would be wonderful extension to the explorer, but also useful to anyone really?
    - Looking at individual transactions
    - Blocks are bundling applications (for consensus)
    - We should want to de-bundle blocks back into applications and their transactions?
    - Classify transactions by "app models"
    - Pattern recognition of different apps to be able to interpret them accordingly
    - Use machine learning?
    - Interpret EUTxO model events into a domain specific form -> could even lead to generic UI and ultimately dApp interfaces
    - Things which would be useful to select relevant subset
        - Addresses
        - Policy id and token names
        - Datum structure
    - Mapping of that subset to another app domain model (application state and transitions)
    - Account abstraction could be an example of such a mapping already
- SN pitched [Cardano Blueprint](https://cardano-scaling.github.io/cardano-blueprint/)
    - Feedback by George: When linking to external documents, mention versions so staleness can be detected easily
