## Meeting notes

- HackMD accepted to take notes, Git repository stays as an archive of meeting notes
- [Mesh Hydra Tools](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/tree/main/packages/hydra) can connect to Hydra nodes and run hydra endpoints via JS/TS, create transactions and submit to hydra, and query all data provided by hydra endpoints
  - [Docs](https://meshjs.dev/providers/hydra) is live
  - Tsz demonstrated how they can be used
  - Next steps: end-to-end tutorial; from open & commit to fan out & close; similar to the one on Hydra docs.
- Hydra now also lists compatible clients [here](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/unstable/docs/clients)
- Elaine use case about japan-local reward "points"
  - Payment system using these "local currencies"
  - Intends to boost local commerce across municipalities in Japan
  - Lots of transactions using mobile clients (QR codes)
  - 1 billion yen (~5 million pounds)
  - Quite similar to what the Hydra team discussed with [Revuto](https://revuto.com/) (for their cashbacks) or [HydraPay](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/hydra-pay)
  - Overlap and possible collaboration with Tudor's payment system
- Discussed a new issue raised by DeltaDefi [hydra#1906](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1906)
  - This is a known gap in the Hydra developer docs
  - dApps need to know how to "interface" with the Head protocol as they want to ensure their dApp state is committed into "proper" heads only
  - Related issue [hydra#1655](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1655)
  - We identified to two things they would care about:
    - The state captured in the UTxO appears unchanged in the head
    - The list of validators running the head

## Action items

- [ ] Make the meeting recordable by multiple attendees
