## Notes

- Doom hydra: AI agents that are going to submit cardano transactions for PvE "multi-player" 
- Caina: muGraph news / agenda another time
- Perry organizing future meetings as a co-chair

- L2s might have different consensus, but eUTxO ledger is a common denominator 
  - SUI: not all transactions are validated the same (e.g. transfers only on a subset?)
  - Idea: people can operate their own head How could that be safe? 
  - Peer to peer, re-use existing ledger to interact with the cardano like have your "personal cardano computer"
 
- Making a transaction act across multiple ledgers
  - Reminds us of Radix ("braiding")
  - Atomic execution across EUTxO ledgers: https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1027.pdf
  - Adaptor signatures: https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/cross-chain-swap-ves/-/blob/master/README.md?ref_type=heads

- Interoperability between Hydra and other L2s in a shiny future 
  - Light wallets as natural entry points
  - High security channels directly usable for payments 
  - If we can re-use those channels to interact with a more permanent side-chain or rollup L2, that'd be great.
  
- EUTxO being more admissible to separating and combining state

- Hydra Heads are shards! We could look more into distributed systems research about non-byzantine, but sharded systems.

- Can we use zk more to overcome consensus limitations (i.e. lower validator numbers)?

- Noon shared the latest state on incremental commits
