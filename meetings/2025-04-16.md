## Agenda

- [x] Phil: L2 interopability
- [x] Seb: Checkpoint snapshots issue [hydra#1744](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1744)

## Attendees

- Tudor
- Franco
- Aaron
- Sebastian
- Phil
- TinyCat

## Meeting notes

- Tudor mentions that they have been working with Elaine since the last meeting
  - joined forces on supply chain tracking
  - interested in similar use cases

- Are meeting recordings shared in a youtube channel?
  - Not really, but sounds interesting
  - Ethereum foundation does it, helpful to catch up
  - Youtube per group and maybe a bigger one to link videos up

- Mithril calls (with researchers) open to public? Would useful Midgard and maybe Hydrozoa
  - Ask them to open it up -> what about the mithril working group?
  - Why? Verify on cardano (in a script) what happens otherwise on cardano (via mithril)
    - Optimistic protocols where an on-chain fraud proving
  - Related to CIP https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/964

- L2 interop
  - individual L2s communicating to each other, while fast and cheap, is not generic
  - another way of interoperability is desirable to have a common denominator across many L2 implementations
  - should be protocol agnostic and as minimal as possible
  - Hydra / Hydrozoa, Gummiworm, Midgard, zkFold would be definitely good candidates to standardize
    - also an AI L2 (photek llc)
    - also Cardano Lightning
  - How is this related to an experiment where we did Hydra Head in a Head?
    - This is an example (very early) of a virtual head, which would be L2-to-L2 communication
    - While that is fine, it is not a unifying standard that avoids fragmentation (e.g. what happened in Ethereum)
  - We should use the opportunity of not having many L2s yet, especially not talking to each other
    - Avoid the problem which emerged in Ethereum where there is no standardized way to interact across L2s
    - Before we have competing L2 interop layers (which still may emerge) which brings social problems
  - This sounds a lot like CPS

    - Problem: L2s emerge, become popular, assets become allocated into those L2s, if no easy way move around -> fragmentation and bad user experience
    - Use cases:
      - wallets knowing how to move assets between L2s
      - DApps that operate across L2s
    - Goals:
      - a standard way to move assets between L2s, using minimal L1 interaction
    - Non-goals:
      - L2 implementation needing to know other L2s
      - L1 interaction is acceptable

- Discussed the checkpointing issue [hydra#1744](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1744)
  - There was (is?) confusion about the concrete use cases
  - Not having rollbacks is a USP of Hydra
  - Often applications will want to observe probabilistic events (esp. Cardano L1)
  - Midgard is using Hydra in some capacity where this would help
  - Phil also mentioned that this could improve UX on deposits
  - We discussed minimum lockup time for deposits
  - Phil has concrete use case ideas and will add some more of that context to the issue

## Action items

- [ ] Really make the meeting recordable by anyone
- [ ] SN: Ask mithril team about a public meeting
- [ ] PDS: Create a discussion forum to draft L2 interop
  - Forum post, hackmd document or just use https://github.com/cardano-scaling/eutxo-l2-interop
- [ ] SN: Draft a CPS about "Generic L2 interoperability"
- [ ] PDS: Try to add some more use case context info to [hydra#1744](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1744)
