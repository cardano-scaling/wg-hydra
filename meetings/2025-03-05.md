## Meeting notes

- Talked about using hackmd as note taking and this already works great as we can type all the same time!
- This note was created and published on hackmd: https://hackmd.io/@wg-hydra/S11jnCSi1g
- We created a hackmd team: https://hackmd.io/@wg-hydra

Gummiworm:
- Motivated by explaining L1 and Hydra trade-offs
  - L1 is very decentralized, but slow
  - Hydra is very fast, and fully secure, but requires "small world"
- Key idea: split responsibilities of execution and custody
- Short term custody vs. long term custody
  - People are fine with more centralized custody in the short term
  - For example in exchange of fast user experience
- Multi-frequency Hydra
  - at least two levels of confirmation
- Validation should be pluggable
  - Big multi-sig at first
  - stake-based or zk solutions thinkable too
- Being able to check the health of the system
  - also to create back pressure
- Good behavior incentivized through slashing = optimistic protocol
  - This makes a lot of sense on Cardano as SPOs could collateralize their pledge
  
DeltaDefi:
- Developing ongoing over last couple months
- Identified critical issues
- Working on Hydra in a way that making sure the software works before care about decentralization (aka Want to ensure no value locked if everyone is honest
- Would move towards more decentralized approach after proving the product is needed by community
- Brought up critical issue: https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1773 
  - We should make sure its linked up with our latest idea how to solve it: https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1858
- Sebastian pointed out that having non-finalizable head states is REALLY unsafe
  - Maybe partial fanouts could help? https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1468
  - Hinson: We think incremental decommit can serve same purpose?
- Other two issues they noticed and will be closely monitoring:
  - https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1871
  - https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1757
