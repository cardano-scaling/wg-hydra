## Meeting notes

- We will transfer the google meet back to Sebastian, where we could have Noon also have full rights

- Notable developments Hydra status update 
  - Bounded memory work 
  - Withdraw zero trick and why it was needed for Glacier drop
  - Mirror nodes investigation: can allow for high-availability hydra-nodes to be resilient against one instance crashing
    - Network consensus (t < n/2) vs. protocol consensus (t < 1)
  - Sideload snapshots
    - Why it is needed?
    - Some situations where this is helpful could be avoided by design or through some retrying logic
    - Until we have solved all those corner cases, the snapshot sideload is going to be an escape hatch for us
    
- Midnight Glacier Drop 
  - Is using Hydra for the initial phase of claiming
  - A cardano L2 application to do the claim verification and produce a merkle tree (or some other authenticated data structure) which will be put on the Cardano L1
  - This will be the ground truth to be used for actual distribution (over time)

- Hydrozoa status update
  - On-chain transaction building (happy path) currently being implemented
  - L2 processing and node-to-node communication next
  - Rule-based regime (fallback L1 txs) coming later
  - Scala-based ledger implementation going to be used
    - started out from the plutus vm implementation
  - Snapshot (= Block) proposes what is accepted from L1 besides the L2 advance
  - Commitment scheme is currently intended to be an MPT
  - Using of linked lists to allow for simultaneous disputes
 
- Also discussed networking with Hydrozoa / Hydra
  - Shared issues of protocol designed around reliable broadcast
  - Why we pivoted into an etcd-based network
  - See also https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/dev/architecture/networking 
  - Hydrozoa L2 protocol is supposedly already designed in a more pull-based manner
  
- Brief idea by perry: Could interhead communication be expressed using Starstream?
  - Maybe
  - Any protocol of individual transactions and scripts could be captured in a starstream program (once it works)
  - For the research it should would just be another level of indirection
  - It's like we are now getting used to build applications using Assembly .. and then someone comes around the corner with a high level language like Go (for example, just came to mind as Go calls its threads coroutines)
